Classifying mice protein expressions on the basis of genotypes | Machine Learning (Jul’20 - Nov’20 )
Instructor: Prof. Amit Sethi, IIT Bombay
◦ Preprocessed the data, imputed missing values and obtained the most important variables w.r.t the mice protein classes
◦ Identified the best classification models on the basis of cross validation scores and performed hyperparameter tuning on random forest classifier and support vector classifier. Obtained an accuracy of 100%.
◦ Visualized the model performances by plotting their learning curves.
